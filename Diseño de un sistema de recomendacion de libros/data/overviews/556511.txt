A VERY classic from Eric Carle, creator of The Very Hungry CaterpillarEarly one morning a little spider spins her web on a fence post. One by one, the animals of the nearby farm try to distract her, yet the busy little spider keeps diligently at her work. When she is done, she is able to show everyone that not only is her creation quite beautiful, it is also quite useful!This multi-sensory book allows children to feel the pictures as well as see them. And with its rhythmic text,  The Very Busy Spider becomes an experience to touch, to see, and to hear."A beautifully executed work for the very young that satisfies the needs of both visually handicapped and sighted children without losing its artistic integrity."--The Horn Book, starred review"Both sighted and blind children will follow the action with ease . . . Visually and verbally, this is a winner."--Booklist, starred review.
