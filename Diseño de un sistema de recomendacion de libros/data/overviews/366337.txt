There's a new shop on Seattle's Blossom Street - a flower shop called Susannah's Garden. The owner, Susannah Nelson, has just hired a young widow named Colette Blake. Susannah and Colette both join Lydia Goetz's new knitting class. Lydia's previous classes have forged lasting friendships and this one is no exception.
