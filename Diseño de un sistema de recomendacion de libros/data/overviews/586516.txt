They were legends based on mythsâ€”myths of fantasy, power, and black magic. The tales of their tours were the most outrageous in the already excess-laden annals of modern music. The era of Led Zeppelin personified sex, drugs, and rock & roll. Based on interviews with the band's musicians, friends, employees, and lovers, Hammer of the Gods tells the shocking story of Led Zeppelin's successes and excesses in the 70sâ€”when Zeppelin reigned as the industry's biggest act. Exclusive sources. Documents. Interviews. Photos. Revelations about a bandâ€”and an industryâ€”at its shameless peak. Read it all, and see why Hammer of the Gods is a classic of rock journalism in its own right.
