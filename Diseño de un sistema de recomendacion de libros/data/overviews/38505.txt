There are many scandalous books about life in Hollywood, but none as poetic and dangerous as this, a fictional chronicle of Bukowski's experiences writing the screenplay for Barfly. Henry Chinaski has a penchant for booze, women and horse-racing. On his precarious journey from poet to screenwriter he encounters a host of well-known stars and lays bare the absurdity and egotism of the film industry. With unmatchable Bukowski verve, Hollywood is deadpan, touching and hilarious.
