The first time I met Chase Parker, I didn’t exactly make a good impression.I was hiding in the bathroom hallway of a restaurant, leaving a message for my best friend to save me from my awful date.He overheard and told me I was a bitch, then proceeded to offer me some dating advice.So I told him to mind his own damn business—his own tall, gorgeous, full-of-himself damn business—and went back to my miserable date.When he walked by my table, he smirked, and I watched his arrogant, sexy ass walk back to his date.I couldn’t help but sneak hidden glances at the condescending jerk on the other side of the room. Of course, he caught me on more than one occasion, and winked.When the gorgeous stranger and his equally hot date suddenly appeared at our table, I thought he was going to rat me out.But instead, he pretended we knew each other and joined us—telling elaborate, embarrassing stories about our fake childhood.My date suddenly went from boring to bizarrely exciting.When it was over and we parted ways, I thought about him more than I would ever admit, even though I knew I’d never see him again.I mean, what were the chances I’d run into him again in a city with eight million people?Then again…What were the chances a month later he’d wind up being my new sexy boss?
