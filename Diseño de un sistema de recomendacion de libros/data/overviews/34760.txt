Twenty-five years ago, Robert Fulghum published a simple credo--a credo that became the phenomenal #1 "New York Times" bestseller "All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten." Now, seven million copies later, Fulghum returns to the book that was embraced around the world. He has written a new preface and twenty-five essays, which add even more potency to a common, though no less relevant, piece of wisdom: that the most basic aspects of life bear its most important opportunities.  Here Fulghum engages us with musings on life, death, love, pain, joy, sorrow, and the best chicken-fried steak in the continental U.S.A. The little seed in the Styrofoam cup offers a reminder about our own mortality and the delicate nature of life . . . a spider who catches (and loses) a full-grown woman in its web one fine morning teaches us about surviving catastrophe . . . the love story of Jean-Francois Pilatre and his hot air balloon reminds us to be brave and unafraid to "fly" . . . life lessons hidden in the laundry pile . . . magical qualities found in a box of crayons . . . hide-and-seek vs. sardines--and how these games relate to the nature of God. "All I Really Need to Know I Learned in Kindergarten "is brimming with the very stuff of life and the significance found in the smallest details.  In the years that have passed since the first publication of this book that touched so many with its simple, profound wisdom, Robert Fulghum has had some time to ponder, to reevaluate, and to reconsider. And here are those fresh thoughts on classic topics, right alongside the wonderful new essays.  Perhaps in today's chaotic, more challenging world, these essays on life will resonate even deeper--as readers discover how universal insights can be found in ordinary events.
