A beautifully illustrated guidebook to drawing human anatomy, from the professor who teaches the subject at the University of Oxford's Ruskin School of Art. Using superb, specially commissioned photographs of male and female models, together with historical and contemporary works of art and her own illustrations, Sarah Simblet shows us how to see inside the human frame, to map its muscle groups and skeletal structure, to capture its balance, poise, and grace.Many of the photographs are overlaid with transparent pages showing the skeletal and muscular systems, so that students can understand how the body's outer appearance relates to its internal anatomy. Lessons focus on different anatomical areas in detail, as well as techniques for seeing and portraying the human body as a whole. In ten "masterclass" sections, Simblet breaks down great works of art, from Hans Holbein's The Body of the Dead Christ to Edward Hopper's Hotel Room, using photographs of models in the same pose to invite readers to see the human body as the masters did.Anatomy for the Artist equips artists of all levels with the skills they need to understand and interpret the human body, and to imaginatively represent it in their own work.
