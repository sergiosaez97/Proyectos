Until he meets Brenna...Brenna Shane Kincaid was an innocent before she was abducted - and had her mind violated - by a serial killer.

Judd is her only hope, yet her sensual changeling side rebels against the inhuman chill of his personality, even as desire explodes between them. Shocking and raw, their passion is a danger that threatens not only their hearts, but their very lives...
