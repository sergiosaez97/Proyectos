The Cat in the Hat returns for more out-of-control fun in this wintry Beginner Book by Dr. Seuss. It’s a snowy day and Dick and Sally are stuck shoveling . . . until the Cat in the Hat arrives to liven things up (to say the least!). Featuring the Cat’s helpers Little Cat A, Little Cat B, and so on, and ending with a gigantic Voom, The Cat in the Hat Comes Back is a riotous, fun-filled follow-up to Dr. Seuss’s classic The Cat in the Hat. Originally created by Dr. Seuss, Beginner Books encourage children to read all by themselves, with simple words and illustrations that give clues to their meaning.
