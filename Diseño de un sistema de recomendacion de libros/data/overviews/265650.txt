The bard's quintessential love story — retold in an elegantly illustrated volume that will appeal both to aficionados of Shakespeare's play and to readers discovering it for the first time.The story has been told "many times by many different people in many different languages," notes Michael Rosen. Now the acclaimed author of SHAKESPEARE: HIS WORK AND HIS WORLD presents the Bard's best-loved play — perhaps of all time — in a beautiful picture book for children. Michael Rosen retells ROMEO AND JULIET scene by scene in a simple, lively style that incorporates the most celebrated passages in their original form, while a border on each spread offers act and scene references and a glossary of difficult words. Exquisite illustrations by Jane Ray complete the production, making this an edition to enthrall the eye as well as the ear.
