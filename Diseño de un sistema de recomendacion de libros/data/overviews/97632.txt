A major national media event when published in hardcover, this delicious follow-up to Bergdorf Blondes was an immediate New York Times bestseller and confirmed Plum Sykes’ status as a literary superstar. Sylvie Mortimer has just married and is blissfully happy with The Divine New Husband, Hunter. Sylvie’s new friend, Lauren Blount, is very rich, very young, very thin, very pretty -- and very, very divorced. The most reckless and glamorous of Manhattan’s Debutante Divorcée set, Lauren captivates Sylvie, the group’s token newlywed. But while Lauren sets out on a morality-lite, orgasm-heavy "Make Out Challenge," Sylvie discovers her marriage isn’t exactly an Eternity ad -- especially when the city’s most notorious Husband Huntress zeros in on her spouse. The Debutante Divorcée delivers all the wit and charm that made Bergdorf Blondes a smash hit. This juicy new tale delighted Sykes’ many fans in hardcover and will continue to earn her new ones in this dazzling, chic paperback edition.
