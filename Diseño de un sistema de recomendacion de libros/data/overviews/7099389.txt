Lincoln Rhyme is back, on the trail of a killer whose weapon of choice cripples New York City with fear.The weapon is invisible and omnipresent. Without it, modern society grinds to a halt.

Soon Rhyme is fighting on yet another front - and his determination to work despite his physical limitations threatens to drive away his closest allies when he needs them most...
