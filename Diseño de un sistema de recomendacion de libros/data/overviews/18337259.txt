A New York Times bestselling epic. A blockbuster TV series. And now, George R. R. Martin’s breathtaking fantasy masterpiece makes its powerful graphic novel debut—with all the majesty, intrigue, full-blooded adventure, and sweeping, mythic vision that have made it a landmark work of imaginative literature. Beyond the legendary Wall, the vast battlement that stands between the kingdom of Winterfell and the untamed unknown, something sinister and supernatural is stirring in the frozen wastes. For the lifelong soldiers of the Night’s Watch, sworn to protect the realm, it is time to prepare for the nearly endless season of cold and snow that—along with something unspeakable—is closing in. For Eddard Stark, Lord of Winterfell and patriarch of a fierce and stoic clan, it is time to greet his king . . . and make ready for whatever destiny holds in store. For an arrogant young prince, it is time to reclaim his lost throne, by bartering his innocent sister to be a savage warlord’s bride. And for a princess bound for a strange and brutal realm, it is time to begin a journey of transformation from daughter to wife to queen. All across the Seven Kingdoms, the wheels of tumultuous, life-changing history have begun to turn.
