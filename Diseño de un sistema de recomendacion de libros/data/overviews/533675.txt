Geppetto is a lonely woodcarver who makes a boy puppet and wishes, with all his might, that the puppet was alive. As Geppetto sleeps, Pinocchio is given life by the Blue Fairy. There's a catch, though. Pinocchio is alive, but he won't be a real boy until he proves himself and to help him, Jiminy Cricket is designated his Official Conscience. In the morning, Geppetto is thrilled to see that his puppet is alive and does what any father would do. He sends Pinocchio off to school - and into trouble. Pinocchio must learn to be honest, and brave, before he is allowed to become a real boy. Will he learn in time?
