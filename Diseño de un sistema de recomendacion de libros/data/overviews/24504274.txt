She’s smart enough to steer clear of those hot, well-built boys with unparalleled stamina. That is until she meets the legendary team captain—Alex Waters.Violet isn’t interested in his pretty, beat-up face, or his rock-hard six-pack abs.

But what starts out as a one-night stand, quickly turns into something more. Post-night of orgasmic magic, Alex starts to call, and text, and e-mail and send extravagant—and quirky—gifts, making him difficult to ignore, and even more difficult not to like.The problem is, the media portrays Alex as a total player, and Violet doesn’t want to be part of the game.
