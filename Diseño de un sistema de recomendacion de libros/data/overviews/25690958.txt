As the mega-talented creator of Grey's Anatomy and Scandal and executive producer of How to Get Away with Murder, and the single mom of three children, Shonda Rhimes had lots of good reasons to say no when an unexpected invitation arrived. Hollywood party? No. Speaking engagement? No. Media appearances? No. (The side benefit of saying No for an introvert like her: nothing new to fear.)Then Shonda's sister laid down a challenge: just for one year, try to say yes to the invitations that come your way. Shonda reluctantly agreed and the result was nothing short of transformative. In Year of Yes, Shonda Rhimes chronicles the powerful impact saying yes had on every aspect of her life and how we can all change our lives with one little word. Yes.
