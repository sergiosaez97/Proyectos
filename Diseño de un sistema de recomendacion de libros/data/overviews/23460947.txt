First there was The English Assassin. Then there was The English Girl. Now comes The English Spy...Master novelist Daniel Silva has thrilled readers with seventeen thoughtful and gripping spy novels featuring a diverse cast of compelling characters, and ingenious plots that have taken them around the globe and back—from the United States to Europe, Russia to the Middle East. His brilliant hero, Gabriel Allon—art restorer, assassin, spy—has joined the pantheon of great fictional secret agents, including George Smiley, Jack Ryan, Jason Bourne and Simon Templar.Following the success of his smash hit The Heist, Daniel Silva returns with another powerhouse of a novel—one that showcases his outstanding skill and brilliant imagination, and which is sure to be a must-read for both his multitudes of fans and growing legions of converts.PRAISE FOR THE ENGLISH GIRL:“Smart, unpredictable, and packed with bits of history, art, heart, and imagination, this is a page-turner to be savored. . . . When it comes to the vast club of practitioners of international spycraft, Silva is a cut above them all, and The English Girl is a masterwork.” —AMAZON.COM“Allon is a great political operative, but Silva is an even greater writer. That is what makes The English Girl a must read.” —HUFFINGTON POST“Although Gabriel’s adventures are set in the real world of greedy politicians and grabs for control of a diminishing supply of natural resources, 'Israel’s avenging angel' has the superhuman abilities that make for a satisfying fantasy.” —COLUMBUS DISPATCH
