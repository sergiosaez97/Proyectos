Bearing an Hourglass is a fascinating, richly imagined tale that reaches beyond the normal science fiction/fantasy realm. When life seems pointless to Norton, he accepts the position of Incarnation of Time. With the other incarnationsâ€”Death, Fate, War, and Nature already distracting him, Satan springs a cunning trap. Science fiction/fantasy legend Piers Anthony combines a gripping plot with a serious and thought-providing study of good and evil.__________Unabridged, 1 audiobook audio file, 13 hours 50 minutes 8 seconds
