But now, into his isolated life, visitors begin to arrive: Fitz’s mentor from his assassin days; a hedge-witch who foresees the return of a long-lost love; and the Fool, the former White Prophet, who beckons Fitz to fulfill his destiny.Then comes the summons he cannot ignore. Prince Dutiful, the young heir to the Farseer throne, has vanished.
