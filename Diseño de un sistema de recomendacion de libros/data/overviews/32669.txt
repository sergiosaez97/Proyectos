At what point does crimanal activity threaten national security? When can a nation respond to it as an enemy? These are questions that Jack Ryan must consider whenn he hears the awful news: Columbian drug lords, tired of being harrased by U.S. law enforcement agents, have assassinated three high American officials, and thet is just the begining. The message is clear. Leave us alone.But they have pushed too far. Someone steps quietly over the line they have drawn, deploying covert-action teams in Columbia. At home, too, men armed with the most sophisticated tools their country can devise begin to take the fight to the real enemy. But does anyone know eho the real enemy is, and how much action is too much? Who is doing what? Which line has been crossed? Ryan and his "dark side," a shadowy field officer known only as Mr. Clark, must find out. They expect danger from without - but the danger from withiin may be the greatest of all.As Clancy takes us through the twists and turns of Clear and Present Danger, he blends the exceptional realism and authenticity that are his hallmarks with inticate plotting, kinfge-edge suspense, and a remarkable cast of characters. This is Clancy at his very best - abd that is the best there is.
