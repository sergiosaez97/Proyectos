Now, 18 years later, Bellamy has written a novel based on Susan's murder. It's her first book, and it's an instant sensation.

Suddenly, she finds herself embroiled in a personal conflict and at the mercy of her sister's killer, who for almost two decades has gotten away with murder...and will stop at nothing to keep it that way.
