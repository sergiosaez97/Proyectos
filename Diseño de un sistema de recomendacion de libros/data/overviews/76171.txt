WE tells the story of the minutely organized United State, where all citizens are not individuals but only he-Numbers and she-Numbers existing in identical glass apartments with every action regulated by the "Table of Hours." It is a community dedicated to the proposition that freedom and happiness are incompatible; that most men believe their freedom to be more than a fair exchange for a high level of materialistic happiness.WE is recognized as the inspiration for George Orwell's famous 1984, and wasn't published in Russia until 1988 due to official censorship. It is generally regarded as a classic Utopian novel and an historic landmark in Soviet literature.
