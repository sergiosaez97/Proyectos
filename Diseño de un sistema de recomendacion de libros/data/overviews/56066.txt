Mary Kay Andrews takes us back to Savannah, Georgia, in Savannah Breeze, the uproarious sequel to her blockbuster New York Times bestseller, Savannah Blues. Breeze is the story of BeBe Loudermilk, a Southern belle who’d dearly like to get back at the handsome, two-faced con man who swindled out of everything she owns except for a broken-down 1950s-era motel on Tybee Island. Joining BeBe on a revenge-inspired road trip south to Fort Lauderdale is her junking friend Weezie, the heroine of Blues, and a car-full of lovable misfits. Readers with a taste for the novels of  Fannie Flagg, Jennifer Crusie, Adriana Trigiani, and Emily Giffin—not to mention Rebecca Wells and Sweet Potato Queens queen Jill Conner Browne—will adore this delightful take on the New South and one woman’s discovery of what’s really important in life.
