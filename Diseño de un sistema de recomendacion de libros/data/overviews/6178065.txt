Itâ€™s another sucky year at Bathory High for Vladimir Tod. The evil vampire Dâ€™Ablo is hunting for the ritual that could steal Vladâ€™s powers. His best friend Henry doesnâ€™t want to be his drudge anymore. And as if all that werenâ€™t enough, itâ€™s getting harder for Vlad to resist feeding on the people around him. When months go by with no word from Uncle Otis and Dâ€™Ablo shows up demanding Vladâ€™s fatherâ€™s journal, Vlad realizes that having a normal high school year is the least of his concerns. Vlad needs to act fast, and even his status as the Pravus wonâ€™t save him this time . . .
